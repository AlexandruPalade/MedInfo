I wanted to crate an applications for hospitals, allows users to view a patient's condition using a smartwatch.

The motivation behind the choice of theme is based on personal research done during the pandemic. I understood then the importance of avoiding the congestion of hospitals but also of its efficiency. 
The application comes to their aid, allowing permanent monitoring of patients without moving staff to wards.

The main porject contains 2 applications:
* Server app - made in Node.js with Express and MongoDB, it serves as the back-end 
* Second item - made in Angular 13, is the main online application
